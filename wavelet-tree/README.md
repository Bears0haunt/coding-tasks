# Wavelet Tree

## Task

The Wavelet Tree is a succinct data structure to store strings in compressed space. It generalizes the Rank and Select operations defined on bitvectors to arbitrary alphabets. You could investigate by yourself on how wavelet tree works and what are rank/select operations. 

The coding task is to finish a wavelet tree implementation: privide the `Quantile Range` interface which returns the K-th smallest value in the subarray. The function definition could be seen in the source code provided. Additionally, you need to provide unit test to guarantee the correctness of your implementation.
